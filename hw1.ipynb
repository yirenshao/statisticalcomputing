    "Surprisingly, the performance of our list of lists implementation is better than Numpy one. This is not what we expected, since Numpy is precisely made for easy and efficient manipulation of vector-like objects. However, we have at least two possible reasons why the former was faster:\n",
    "- __The use of the method append in Task 2:__ In task 2, for the function advent_step(), for the first loop, instead of replacing the values of the original matrix, we create an empty list and we append each modified list to this new list of lists. Using append method has a time complexity of O(1), which is scalable.\n",
    "- __The use of only one deepcopy() in Task 2:__ In task 2, for the function advent_step(), we never used deepcopy. Instead, we extracted the rows one by one and appended them. We did something similar with the columns. We only had to use deepcopy() once in advent_solve(), and it was not part of a loop."
